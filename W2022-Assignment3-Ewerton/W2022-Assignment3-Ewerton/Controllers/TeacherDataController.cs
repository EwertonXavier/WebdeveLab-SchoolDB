// Upgrade proposal: Function QuerySchoolDB( string query)
// I had created a class to query the school database and return result as a Array String(other project, same assignment).
// I thought about working to transform the results into a JSON and then creating objects using them.
// The advantage would be a reusable function to query the SchoolDB receiving a query as parameter
// Maybe I am going to work on this in the future.
